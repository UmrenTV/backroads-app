# Backroads App

---

This a test app that I used for improving my React/Next knowledge, and it's a simple Tour Company landing page.

---

This app is built in ReactJS.

---

I had project similar to this built in HTML5 / CSS and VanillaJS so I wanted to convert it to React using Javascript and train myself converting projects and stuff.
